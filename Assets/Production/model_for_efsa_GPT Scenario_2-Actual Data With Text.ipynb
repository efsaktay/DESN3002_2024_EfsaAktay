First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!! @thesheetztweetz @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often &amp; is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing. @SciGuySpace @Some1gee Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That‚Äôs the acid test. @SciGuySpace True. Only reason other medium &amp; heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention.

This is a *major* breakthrough. @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog But now we understand production much better. It will be our primary competitive advantage long-term. @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog Even GM &amp; Chrysler went bankrupt in 2009. Ford and Tesla are the only US car companies that have avoided bankruptcy. @raytech247 @WholeMarsBlog The Model 3 production ramp was sheer agony for two years, but that was do or die for Tesla. No US car company has reached high volume production with sustained free cash flow in ~100 years. Hundreds of car startups all died or were absorbed for peanuts by big three. @EvaFoxU @WholeMarsBlog Bringing a new product to volume production is 1% inspiration &amp; 99% perspiration. You do still need that critical seed of inspiration, but it‚Äôs fun &amp; takes ~100 people. Production takes &gt;10,000 people &amp; hurts like hell until the gigantic cybernetic collective runs smoothly. @skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate. @WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part. @WholeMarsBlog We do expect to make heavy use of LFP for medium range cars &amp; stationary storage @WholeMarsBlog Berlin will use 4680 cell with structural battery pack &amp; front &amp; rear single piece castings.
